# Streamer.Bot-Actions - Echo

1. Download and Import [the Action](Echo.sb)
2. Connect the Action to any kind of Trigger (Command, Channel Point Reward, etc.) - **It needs to have the rawInput Variable set, else it'll just send back `%rawInput%`.**
3. Run the Trigger
4. Streamer.Bot should now respond with the same Text that you entered in the Trigger (After the command or in the text input field if it is a channel point redemption)
