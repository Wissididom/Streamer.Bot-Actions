# Streamer.Bot-Actions - SpeakWithSpeakerBot

1. Download and Import [the Action](SpeakWithSpeakerBot.sb)
2. Connect the Action to any kind of Trigger (Command, Channel Point Reward, etc.) - **It needs to have the rawInput Variable set, else it'll just send back `%rawInput%`.**
3. Make sure you type the name of an Voice Alias inside the Speaker.bot Speak Sub-Action that you created in Speaker.bot.
4. Run the Trigger
5. Streamer.Bot should now speak the text that you entered in the Trigger (After the command or in the text input field if it is a channel point redemption)
