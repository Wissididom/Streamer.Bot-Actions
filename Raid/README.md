# Streamer.Bot-Actions - Raid

1. Download and Import [the Action](Raid.sb)
2. Connect the `Raid` Action to an Trigger (`Twitch->Raid->Raid Start` or `Twitch->Raid->Raid Send`) (`Raid Start` is when the Raid-Countdown starts and `Raid Send` is when the Viewers are getting sent to the other channel. Choose when you prefer the Action being executed)
3. Streamer.Bot should now automatically send in Chat where the Raid will go/went on an Outgoing Raid. By Default the format is `%raidUser%: https://www.twitch.tv/%raidUserName%` (e. g. `Wissididom: https://www.twitch.tv/wissididom`)
